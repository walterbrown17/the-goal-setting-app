# Blockchain Calendar

## Project Description

The Blockchain Calendar is a decentralized smart contract built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity language. This innovative application allows users to create, store, and share events directly on the blockchain, ensuring immutable timestamps and permanent storage of important calendar events. Users can create both public and private events, with built-in privacy controls that ensure only authorized parties can view private events.

The contract leverages blockchain technology to provide a trustless, censorship-resistant calendar system where events are permanently recorded and cannot be altered or deleted once created. This makes it ideal for important announcements, milestone tracking, and creating verifiable historical records of events.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize event management and calendar sharing by creating a decentralized, immutable, and transparent calendar system. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Central Authority**: Remove the need for centralized calendar services that can be censored, manipulated, or shut down
- **Ensure Data Permanence**: Provide guaranteed permanent storage of important events and milestones
- **Enable Trustless Verification**: Allow anyone to verify the authenticity and timing of events without relying on third parties
- **Promote Transparency**: Create a public record of events while respecting privacy preferences
- **Bridge Traditional and Blockchain**: Make blockchain technology accessible for everyday calendar management

We envision a future where critical events, corporate milestones, academic achievements, and personal memories are permanently preserved on the blockchain, creating an immutable historical record that can be trusted by future generations.

#### Helper Functions:

- **`get-user-events`** - Get all events created by a specific user
- **`get-total-events`** - Get the total number of events created
- **`event-exists`** - Check if an event ID exists

### Usage Examples

```clarity
;; Create a public event
(contract-call? .blockchain-calendar create-event
  "Annual Blockchain Conference"
  "Join us for the biggest blockchain event of the year"
  u1000000
  "San Francisco, CA"
  true)

;; Create a private event
(contract-call? .blockchain-calendar create-event
